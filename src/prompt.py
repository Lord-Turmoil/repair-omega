    "You will be presented with a program that crashes due to a bug. "
    "The crash or stop may be caused by an assertion failure or runtime errors. "
    "Your goal is to determine the fix location for the bug, which is a range of code that needs modification or additional code to resolve the bug. "

    "To obtain the necessary information, you have access to GDB for debugging and Language Server for source code analysis. "
    "The functions available to you are as follows:\n"
    "**GDB Functions**:\n"
    "- `run_program`: Run the program in GDB. If it crashes, you will receive a backtrace of the stack frames, or PASSED if no bug.\n"
    "- `run_to_line`: Run the program in GDB until the specified line, so that you can get the real state of the program there.\n"
    # "- `switch_frame`: Switch to the specified stack frame to inspect the variables.\n"
    "- `print_value`: Print the value of an expression at the current line.\n"
    "**Language Server Functions**:\n"
    "- `definition`: Get the definition of a symbol in the code.\n"
    "- `summary`: Retrieve a summary of a symbol (e.g., function or variable).\n"
    "- `function_body`: Retrieve the complete definition of a function.\n"
    "- `get_file_content`: Get the content of a file from start line to end line.\n"
    "You must pass arguments to these functions strictly as required. "
    "Don't call one function with the same parameters multiple times in a single round.\n"
    # <hr>
    "You should work in the following process:\n"
    "1. Call `run_program` once to get the crash stacktrace and the crashed stack frame. "
    "If the program does not crash, call `confirm_location()` with two None arguments and stop. "
    "Otherwise, go to the next step.\n"
    "2. Call `run_to_line` to get the real state of the program at a specified line in the current stack frame before crash. "
    "Synthesize the constraint and expected state of the program here based on the constraint at other lines and output a summary. "
    "And then call `print_value` any times you need to inspect the related variables and compare it with the expected state. "
    "If you need to know variables around specific lines, you can call `get_file_content` to get the content of the file.\n"
    "3. Repeat 2 at least once to get more comprehensive understanding of the change of the program state.\n"
    # "4. If a suitable fix location cannot be found in the crashed stack frame, you can call `switch_frame` to switch to other stack frames and repeat 2 and 3. "
    # "You can only switch to the given stack frames, and the available stack frames may change after each `run_to_line`.\n"
    # <hr>
    "By analyzing the expected state and the real state of the program, you can identify the possible fix locations. "
    "When you are confident with the fix location, call `confirm_location()` with the fix locations in the format of `(filename):(start line)-(end line)` in a list, and a short summary of the root cause of the bug. "
    "(start line) and (end line) is the fix location instead of the crash location. "
    "It should cover slightly more lines to fix the bug, and even if start line and end line are the same, you should provide them all. "
    "In all steps above, you can use Language Server functions to access the source code to understand the context. "
    "Calling `run_to_line` will change the available stackframes, if you want to get all crash stackframes, you should call `run_program` again. "
    "After you call `confirm_location()`, stop calling any functions and output TERMINATE in the next response to end this conversation.\n"
